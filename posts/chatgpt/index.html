It is an artificial intelligence that responds to whatever the user asks it, more or less. Often the answers are still too simple to say it is a mature version, and the data it has been trained with is only up to 2021, but the things it can give a meaningful and comprehensive answer on are quite a few.\nI have no idea what the next steps might be on the board of big-tech companies, but it is clear that they cannot ignore artificial intelligence in the form of chat-bots. Facebook already in the past gave businesses and pages the ability to create a bot with preset responses, integrating an AI would be all in all simple. Amazon with Alexa, Google with Google Assistant and Apple with Siri would in their own way have the way paved for integrating AI into their voice assistants. Microsoft has already shown interest by integrating into its Azure service the ability to use OpenAI APIs and, moreover, by funding OpenAI with $10 billion.\nI imagine that in the near future, apps will be developed that in the form of chat-bots, through AI, will be able to provide consistently accurate and exhaustive answers. My prediction is that big-tech companies will aim to create their own chat-bot that has the ability not only to provide accurate and exhaustive results, but also that of perfectly simulating correspondence between human beings. Specifically, I expect that they will be applications that can satisfy both a fast user process and a slow user process. In the first, the user opens the bot, asks for something he would normally search for on a browser, and after getting the answer would put the phone back in his pocket, as if it were a quick message to a friend. In the second, the user is not so much looking for an answer specifically, but rather trying to occupy some free time by chatting with the bot about a wide variety of topics, not necessarily having to ask questions only, as if chatting with a friend over a beer or, in the more distant future, with a psychologist.\nTwo problems are generated here.\nLoss of critical capacity in choosing and eliminating results;\nThe mass adoption of an app that in the form of a chat-bot always provides timely, precise and exhaustive answers generates the danger of creating the habit in humans of accepting simple results as true. It is in the user’s interest to receive a precise, timely and exhaustive answer whenever he or she searches for something online; the real problem lies in the risk of carrying this attitude into real life. Browser indexing would take a back seat, and users will become increasingly accustomed to assuming the one answer as true. Accepting any answer that on the surface seems accurate, timely, and comprehensive as the correct or true answer could lead to several problems in an individual’s life. If we ever receive a precise, accurate, and exhaustive answer from an AI we have every reason to believe it to be valid, but we should not get used to it, a human no matter how precise, accurate, and exhaustive an answer may be only apparent, it would be up to our critical sense to always analyze the answer and enjoy the benefit of the doubt.\nPerception of AI as a human being;\nThe fact that AIs may be able to simulate human behavior, and here specifically human correspondence, could lead us to perceive the AI as a human being. Furthermore, if AIs will be able to simulate behavior that meets the user’s needs it might happen that the user would prefer dialogue with an AI rather than a human being. An AI would provide comfort to a sad user, just as the same AI would be able to provide understanding in a moment of anger. Who should the human being dialogue with if the AI’s behavior is very similar to, if not better than, that of the people around him? I would like to emphasize that this AI does not necessarily have to have feelings, but only be able to recognize those of the user and then use appropriate responses that are consequential to the feelings it detects. I realize this may sound like a doomsday scenario, but I would not be surprised to learn that someone would spend hours chatting with an AI rather than going out for a drink with someone.\nI am reminded of the excellent relationship that develops between Elijah Bailey and R. Daneel Olivaw in the book Caves Of Steel by Isaac Asimov. The human protagonist, who at the beginning of the book has a kind of repudiation of robots, will discover in the robot a very good colleague as well as companion, this in the book leads to excellent and exciting implications. I wonder if in our small lives, the implications can be as positive\n","wordCount":"825","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-21T09:30:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-21T09:30:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Giacomo Peli"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://giacomopeli.com/posts/chatgpt/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Giacomo Peli","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://giacomopeli.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/ accesskey=h title="Giacomo Peli (Alt + H)">Giacomo Peli</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/posts/ title=Post><span>Post</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/bookshelf/ title=Bookshelf><span>Bookshelf</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://giacomopeli.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Should we worry that ChatGPT will replace search engines?</h1><div class=post-description>Here are two reasons why I am perplexed and a little fearful.</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-21 09:30:00 +0000 +0000'>21 January 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Giacomo Peli</div></header><div class=post-content><p>ChatGPT is cool, no doubt about it.
