Netbooks were machines that retain all notebooks features in a small and often awkward body. Only now you can imagine that their purpose was to be able to surf the net and be carried around comfortably. Have they fulfilled this in the last decade? Not at all. Nowadays it doesn’t make sense to buy a netbook because notebooks have become faster and lighter, smartphone screens are bigger and tablets are more efficient than 10 years ago. You have many better options for surfing the Internet than an old netbook. So what made me want one? From the moment I started writing articles for this blog, I needed a machine that could navigate the Internet well enough and allowed me to write without distraction and I wanted a very simple machine that I could turn as much as possible into a typewriter, but also support me with small research tasks, but my main notebook can do this very well. I thought having a slower, simpler, smaller computer might help me think better and stay focused what I’m doing. Having a small screen doesn’t allow me to open unnecessary windows in my workspace and having a slower cpu won’t let me to do anything but write and browse. Now I have a specifc machine to do a specific task that requires all of me, that’s the point. Then let’s face it,\nhaving a custom netbook in 2022 is cool.\nHaving super powerful hardware doesn’t make your machine run well, how many average users with super spec hardware have slow computers? Many. It depends on how much you can squeeze and optimize that hardware to run at its best, in fact a low spec 10’s optimized and upgraded netbook can handle the 20’s better than a new and stock low spec notebook. This is true for any old hardware we are talking about.\nMy netbook My girlfriend got this netbook in high school years ago for free, now it has been abandoned on some shelf gathering dust because it was unusable with Windows and due to its touchpad problem. I asked her to give it to me as a gift and she was kind enough to give it to me right away. She knows I like to geek out. This netbook is an Acer Travelmate B115 with an Intel Celeron 2830 dual core at 2,41 GHz with 4 Gb of ram and 240 Gb hard disk and it is fanless. Now I have upgraded it to 8 Gb of ram and to a 240 Gb SSD, solved the touchpad problem and installed a Linux distro. Since this will be my second computer and I’ll be spending some hours with it, I took care of every single detail and I did all the things the way I wanted them to be. Not only I have fixed the problems it had, but I made it even better and usable in 2022 and for a few more years. For a laptop released in 2014 I think it is a perfect result. Will your laptop last at least 8 years?\nDisassembly phase Every notebook is built in a different way and as it is more engineered it will become more difficult to disassemble it, however nothing too hard to do. You have to disassemble it because you need to see what’s inside, what upgrades you can do and what is the dust level. Generally, if you’re lucky, you only have to unscrew the bottom side of your laptop and the detach it, but in other cases, after removing the bottom screws, you have to detach the keyboard and access it from there.\nFirst look in the B115 Clean it First of all, touch the ground with your hands, disconnect the battery and only then start cleaning it. You can do it with a compressor, an air can or simply with a small, soft brush, but only if you have the hands of a surgeon. During this and future operations it is better if you wear latex or nitrile gloves. I clean mine with a small brush, I have done it many times and I know what I do.\nUpgrades As you open your computer, you’ll see which parts you can upgrade. Since we’re talking of old machines, 99,99% of the time you can upgrade the hard disk with an SSD. You need to look for the ram, usually, on old machines, you can upgrade it as there is little chance it was welded on the board. You can find machines with some gigs already welded on the board but with an unused slot and this is the best situation because you don’t replace the ram, but you add gigs to it.\nUpgrade to 8 Gb of ram I don’t know what you need, but in this kind of computer 120 Gb are enough. If you need more gigs, buy a bigger SSD. You don’t need to buy the faster SSD on the market, but a sub-brand one can be fine because an old motherboard will not use the full speed of the SSD.\nUpgrade to 240 SSD The only essential thing you need to buy is thermal paste because the old one will be dry and inefficient. Giving your laptop a fresh thermal paste is probably the best upgrade you can make.\nOld thermal paste is cleaned I always keep some thermal paste in my desk drawer, so in my case I have bought a 240 ssd and an 8 Gb DDR3L ram. As my netbook is fanless, changing the thermal paste was fundamental for having low temperature, now with daily tasks CPU never goes over 44°C, tan oustanding result for a fanless netbook.\nSolving problems The B115 is known online for its touchpad problems and if you search it online you will see many threads on forums, posts on Reddit and videos on Youtube. Acer has released on its support page for the B115 drivers and bios upgrades to fix this problem, but this persists. When you use this touchpad, you’ll see the pointer take on a life of its own and wander around the monitor and you can’t stop it. The reason is that the area inside the computer corresponding to the touchpad has been poorly designed: an unshielded cable runs exactly over the unshielded flat cable of the touchpad, so the signal to the motherboard is largely disturbed. The unshielded non-flat cable connects the speakers so if you’re listening to some audio or watching a video, since some signal is sent through the flat cable, you’ll see you will see the wandering pointer taking control of your computer. Solution? Wrap the unshielded cable in aluminum foil to eliminate any interference.\nBefore and after shielding the cable I added some pieces of adhesive foam in order to eliminate the void sound when typing and to give an extra solid feel.\nOperative system, software and personalization I knew in advance that Windows does not run well, so I installed Linux. Out of curiosity, however, I first tried to install Windows 10 first, but with very poor results. I didn’t want to have problems with stability and updates, so I installed Kubuntu, as I’m a KDE fan. When you install a Linux distro you end up formatting the disk after a few months because of the junk that accumulates, for this I have chosen a flavour of Ubuntu with KDE and also because I know it quite well.\nSmall note for Linux users: I say this for the average user, on my main machine I’m using Arch. Should I have spent more time to install and optimize Arch when Ubuntu was enough for this two-tasks machine? I don’t think so.\nZero Office Suite Since I am permanently eliminating office suites from my life in favor of text compilers, I will use neither Libre Office nor Open Office, but a simple markdown editor: Mark Text. Sometimes I will use VS Code, but Mark Text is becoming my first choice for carefree writing. You can export your document as .md, .html and .pdf. Exported documents are neatly formatted and the style can be changed by inserting a CSS file in the configuration files. I highly recommend you ditch programs like Microsoft Office Word and give Latex and Markdown a shot, you don’t need to be a developer or programmer, they are really simple and once you learn them you won’t use any office type programs anymore. Mark Text is a great way to take this step. As for university notes, I write in Latex and use Overleaf as my compiler, and I am really excited and proud of it. However, I type this way even when I use Windows, you don’t have to be a Linux user.\nsudo pacman -S libreoffice Yes, I really had to do it on my main machine since someone sent me his .docx document (pacman as now I’m using Arch).\nPolybar I customized my desktop by adding a bar with Polybar, but what Linux user doesn’t? Unlike overly elaborate rice, I didn’t use any plugins or community modules, just Polybar and KDE with the standard color scheme, as I generally tend to use. No menu management software, but I created a menu with submenus directly in the Polybar config with Firefox, Mark Text and Shutdown entries. No menu that give me access to network management, I use the terminal with nmtui command. Since it’s fanless I want to keep an eye on the CPU and motherboard temperatures, at least in this first phase of use, then maybe take them off. I’m still working on it, maybe not a beautiful result, but good enough.\nFinal rice of the B115 Which models can you look for? If I hadn’t been lucky enough to get this laptop for free, I would have looked at other models. If you want to replicate what I did you can keep an eye on the following models that I think are out of class, which you will be noticed by people and have a lot of fun with.\nDell Latitude 2100\nHP Mini 501\nHP Mini 502\nHP Mini 503\nAcer Travelmate B115\nAcer Travelmate B116\nAcer Travelmate B117\nSamsung N110\nPostcards from future The bank of 4 Gb left over from this netbook I wanted to put it in my girlfriend’s notebook upgrading its ram, from that moment it stopped working with the battery and in no way I was able to restart it without the charger, despite trying every kind of reset and discharge. Also, as if that were not enough, in all this trying to fix even the touchpad stopped working. It was fun to play with this netbook, but did I really need it? No, so I preferred to return it to my girlfriend whose notebook I destroyed. Now she has a great netbook!\nThanks to Riccardo which inspires me a lot when doing this tech stuff. He writes on Pressappoco and he’s working on Marea.\n","wordCount":"1872","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://giacomopeli.com/posts/netbookcover.jpg","datePublished":"2022-02-18T11:30:03Z","dateModified":"2022-02-18T11:30:03Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Giacomo Peli"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://giacomopeli.com/posts/netbook/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Giacomo Peli","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://giacomopeli.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/ accesskey=h title="Giacomo Peli (Alt + H)">Giacomo Peli</a>

Also, as if that were not enough, in all this trying to fix even the touchpad stopped working. It was fun to play with this netbook, but did I really need it? No, so I preferred to return it to my girlfriend whose notebook I destroyed. Now she has a great netbook!</p><p>Thanks to <a href=https://riccardo.im/>Riccardo</a> which inspires me a lot when doing this tech stuff.
