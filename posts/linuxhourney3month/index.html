I’ve always resurrected old hardware by installing Linux, for a long time I’ve done distrohopping1 with Linux distributions and I’ve also used for some time Linux as my main system. But every time I’ve dropped to Windows since many softwares I needed exist only for Microsoft systems and, moreover, since I was inexperienced I’ve often broken my Linux systems.\nThis year I decided to make an effort to use Linux as my main operating system and learn it in depth. I thought that writing an update post every three months would be a nice thing to summarize what I learn and what difficulties I encounter, so here we are!\nI decided to use Arch Linux as my distribution since it is the one that offers the fastest learning curve. So I bought an online introductory course to learn the basics like pacman, Timeshift, system cleanup and general maintenance: best money spent this year. It makes you wonder if I couldn’t have learned these things by searching online and watching free tutorials, but to tell the truth there isn’t much material online for novice users and having a bundle of well explained and condensed basic knowledge has been the perfect starting point.\nLinux is elitist One of the things I’ve learned from frequenting the maze of Linux communities is that Linux is elitist. Those who use Linux are undoubtedly part of an elite group for several reasons. I know what you’re thinking, and no, I don’t mean to say that Linux users are smarter than other people2. Rather, it would be more accurate to say that people who use Linux are reacting to the apathy that comes with today’s technology and have greater awareness of the technology around them. They know that their data is not being spied on by Cortana on behalf of Microsoft or Siri on behalf of Apple.\nIn these three months I have personally met one of the most educated people I could meet and guess what operating system he uses? Linux! I told him that I didn’t understand why people like scientists or engineers, often aware of the downsides of Windows or macOS, wouldn’t use Linux and that if we think about it they would be the very first people to have to use it. In my imagination an engineer would never use Windows, but I have never physically met an engineer who uses Linux. Also if we look closely, in both middle school and high school computer science courses, the existence of Linux is hardly ever mentioned, even though it would be the right way to learn computer science. He told me that it’s okay: forcing people to learn something is the wrongest thing you can do for them to learn it and also that, if schools took this step, Linux would become much more mainstream and that\nthe things that become more common are not so special anymore.\nLinux users are the only 2% of the desktop market share so it’s a normal consequence if Linux users develop an elitist attitude. Being the 2% is being an elite group.\nRicing When a novice gets into Linux communities one of the first thing he faces is ricing. But what does it mean? One of the best apsects of Linux is that literally everything can be modified and customized for the user’s necessities. When a Linux user modifies is desktop ui in order to make it more aesteticcaly simplify and speed up his workflow he is making a rice or he’s ricing his desktop.\nIn this period I’ve tried many desktop environments and many windows manager as i3. I’ve experienced how a good tiling3 works, changed many themes and colour scheme, changed icons and fonts. Trying all those exotic things made me know my necessities and how I want my desktop looks and work. Ricing the perfect desktop requires a lot of time, so, in my opinion, the key is to keep a desktop environment that can be easily customized and that can cover the most of your necessities, and if necessary installing additional softwares.\nAs my workflow is still mouse centric, but I love the efficiency of tiling I opted for KDE Plasma with Krohnkite on Xorg. My mouse is an MX Master 3 so I personalized it with logiops and also I’ve customized the tocuhpad gestures. When I open a windows it opens as a tiled one, but if I want a window floats on my desktop I press Super+F and it starts to float, but when a window floats, I want it in the center of my desktop and all I have to do is pressing Super+C to move it in the perfect center of my screen. Everything in my system is as I want and my workflow has never been so fast.\nIt can be said that ricing is customizing an evironment in order to adapt it to the user necessities instead of forcing a workflow in a predetermined environment made by someone else. Many users have to adapt their workflow for Windows or macOS UI4, but now I’ve an environment that adapts to my workflow.\nBeing faster As I’m using Linux daily I feel I’m becoming more skilled and fast on doing my daily tasks. Also my computer is faster and smoother than with Windows installed and my hardware works cooler. As I’ve the total control on what my hardware is doing, my tasks have more resources and I work more serene.\nLinux downsides Even if I want to strictly use Linux as now it is my comfort zone, I can’t use it every time because some software I use are only for Microsoft system and there are not any option that worth. Also when I work with other people on projects and share things with them it becomes difficult, but I know that it isn’t my fault because they’re using Microsoft Office Suite and I use LaTex. And we know, LaTex is for outliers.\nSee you in September!\nDistrohopping means when you hop from one distribution to another and keep reinstalling new ones to try them out. Generally this is done by newbs. ↩︎\nAlthough there are other reasons and all the grounds to think so. For example, Linux users are more literate than Windows or macOS users. ↩︎\nTiling is a different way to manage windows on the desktop. Generally in Windows the windows are floating on the desktop. ↩︎\nAnd let me say that macOS desktop environment is awful, windows always open in a different way. ↩︎\n","wordCount":"1112","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://giacomopeli.com/posts/archlinux.png","datePublished":"2022-05-17T10:30:03+02:00","dateModified":"2022-05-17T10:30:03+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Giacomo Peli"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://giacomopeli.com/posts/linuxhourney3month/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Giacomo Peli","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://giacomopeli.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/ accesskey=h title="Giacomo Peli (Alt + H)">Giacomo Peli</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/posts/ title=Post><span>Post</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/bookshelf/ title=Bookshelf><span>Bookshelf</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://giacomopeli.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Linux is elitist, and that's okay! - My Linux Journey - Part 1</h1><div class=post-description>My firt three months with Arch Linux.</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-05-17 10:30:03 +0200 CEST'>17 May 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Giacomo Peli</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://giacomopeli.com/posts/archlinux.png alt="sudo pacman -Syu"><p>sudo pacman -Syu - This computer will receive some nice updates</p></figure><div class=post-content><p>It&rsquo;s wrong to say that I started my journey with Linux three months ago as I&rsquo;ve been using Linux since I was 14, maybe 15, years old.
