I started to do my research, but in the end I always found always netbooks that were too old, with Intel Atom processors, battered and way too expensive for their value. So I started looking for newer models with a Intel Celeron 4020 processor. In absolute terms these computers do not cost much, but it is difficult to to find one that is compact enough and has good portability.\nI therefore decided to narrow down my search. The characteristics of the computer I was looking for were\nPanel under 13 inches Good keyboard Something really interesting I found is the Asus E210, a small notebook under 12 inches that came out recently. I went to see it in a physical store and I have say that it is more than decently built. Online you can’t find anything under 170€, a price that definitely exceeded my budget.\nGood keyboard? Compact? Well, Lenovo Thinkpad X series. Thus began my search for the Thinkpad X220 and X230. The X220 have one of the best keyboard ever built on laptops, made by IBM, but this model mount second-generation Intel processors, instead, the X230 mounts third-generation Intel processors, but have an updated keyboard compared to the X220. I have tried both keyboards and let’s face it, the keyboard on the X230, the one I am writing this article with, is a very good keyboard and, although many people prefer the old one made by IBM, in my opinion there is not that much difference in build quality. On the plus side, the IBM keyboard can be mounted on the X230 without any problem and by fiddling with the BIOS a bit. Replacing the keyboard would be a splurge among future upgrades, but I am getting along very well already with the upgraded version and do not want to increase the cost of this project. Upgrading the keyboard of the X230 with that of the X220 would provide the best of both worlds, so I chose the X230.\nThe ebay auction The first auction I attended was of an X230 with broken arrow keys, 128 Gb SSD, the battery capacity was not optimal and the overall condition was not among the best. I bid 105€ and did not win it for 106€. I was both disappointed at not getting it and glad for not getting a bad deal, and it really would have been.\nThe second auction I followed was of an X230 declared as good as new with no obvious signs of use, a new 256 Gb SSD, but the battery capacity was stated to be 10%. Intrigued by this, I jokingly put in as a maximum bid 100€ knowing that I would not win it, given the previous auction figure. Could I have purchased a better model at a lower price? No. Instead, that’s exactly what happened. Forgetting about the auction, I find a payment notification with amount of 92€ (excluding shipping). Jackpot!\nUnboxing and good vibes The package arrives from Germany early. I feel like a child unwrapping his own birthday present and, in fact, it was. The Thinkpad was not in its original packaging of course, but what could I have expected from a 10 year old notebook? Nonetheless, after unpacking I felt a wonderful feeling, which I very rarely experience with technology.\nBattery check According to the seller’s description, I had already considered that the first thing to be replaced would be the battery, but I decided to to check it anyway. It is a 9-cell model, the oversized version. After slipping it out of its housing I notice that it is the original one marked Lenovo. I then installed Linux Mint, putting off installing Arch until a few hours later. From the live feed of Linux Mint I notice that the battery is at 80% capacity. Basically, the vendor had stated that the battery had lost just more than 10% capacity and not that the capacity was 10% as I thought it was. This could not have worked out better for me. The 9-cell battery original Lenovo for Thinkpad X220 and X230 cost quite a bit, as third-party ones degrade much more easily and are unlikely to maintain constant capacity over time. I therefore install Linux Mint, check that all the hardware is working properly and uninstall it.\nArch Linux, btw I notice that the installation of Linux Mint is super smooth and I have to say that I was quite sad to have to format the disk to install Arch, but I did it anyway otherwise I could never have said I use Arch, btw.\nAh, I forgot to specify that the seller did not have any operating system installed so I assume that the SSD of 256 Gb that was mounted is new.\nMy custom setup for Thinkpad X230 I don’t like to waste time fiddling with configuration files to make visually beautiful but impractical receptions. I have already explained what I think about it in a previous article. Basically I use KDE as it comes out of the installation and make some light modifications. On this Thinkpad, Wayland runs like a charm and even the 1:1 gestures work with the tiny trackpad on these models.\nI installed Move Windows to Center a KWin’s script to move unmaximized windows to the center of the desktop and assigned it the shortcut Meta+C (I set the Windows key on each of my devices as the Meta key). You can find it here.\nThe ThinkVantage button, which on Windows would have a very specific function, on Linux turns out to be as useless as it is useful when we consider that its function can be customized as we wish. I set the shortcut to open the KDE overview, a function that I love about this de and find really useful.\nThis is, nothing more and nothing less. Quick to set up and effective. How much time would I have wasted to make a rice that consumes 200MB less of RAM? Remind me to upgrade the RAM to 16GB when I’ll saturate the 8GB on this Thinkpad. I’m ironic, of course.\nBecause I want to go as stock as possible and support KDE I am writing this article with Kate. the text editor from the KDE suite that can’t miss in any of my installations. I also installed markdownpart which allows me to write in markdown format having a real-time preview on the side. I usually use Mark Text a great software to write in markdown, but compiling on Arch is really time consuming and not worth it.\nI modified my bashrc file by inserting pfetch and a script that tells me the processor temperature.\nAnalyze temperatures and fan to avoid changing thermal paste Processor temperatures are slightly higher than a low-power eighth-generation Intel U-series processor, but they are still around 50°C, and at this very moment when I am writing this it is 43°C and the fan has not started, as if it were fanless.\nAt full speed it even reaches over 70°C. The air outlet slots are located on the left side of the laptop and if you rest your left hand on the desk to the side of the Thinkpad you can feel the warm air, but nothing too annoying. It will be pleasant to use this winter!\nSeveral online users have complained that the fans on these models are quite noisy. True, the fan can be heard, but in very light and only at high load. I have very fine hearing and usually the fans on desktop desktops bother me a lot, but the one of my Thinkpad most people would not even hear it.\nHaving made these considerations, I have decided not to disassemble the Thinkpad just to replace the thermal paste, but I will only take the opportunity when I make upgrades.\nUpgrades I’m considering Among the various upgrades I have seen online there are:\nRetrofitting the X220 keyboard As mentioned above, the keyboard on the X230 can be replaced with the better one on the X220. IBM keyboards in Italian are hard to find; it is a very popular upgrade and one that many X230 owners make. After writing this article I can say that I don’t have any need it, I am already very comfortable with it.\nHere you can find a video of Classic Dome about the keyboard swap.\nExpress Card with 3x USB 3.0 On online ecommerce stores you can find express cards compatible with three USB 3.0 ports. Having three additional USB 3.0 ports on this Thinkpad would not be bad, but it still remains a whim since I would not need them. Also, these expresscards remain always powered and drain power from the battery, which is definitely inconvenient.\nSomething similir to what I mentioned above. Image from a Reddit post. RAM upgrade I’ve bought it with 8 Gb yet, upgrading it to 16 Gb would be useless.\nStorage upgrade I bought this Thinkpad with a new 256GB SSD, and I don’t feel like I need to increase the space further. However, this Thinkpad has a WWAN module that allows internet connection via a sim card. I don’t know if I will ever use this feature and, in fact, I am considering replacing this WWAN card with a 128GB msata SSD where I could place my Linux /home folder.\nDisplay IPS One of the downsides of this Thinkpad is that it mounts a TN panel, which is quite ugly and impractical for everyday use. Perhaps, for writing, I could compromise with this, although at the moment it remains a pain to see the colors of different shades between the top and bottom of the display. While looking for the right angle to make up for this gap between too light and too dark, I cannot find a reason to keep this panel. Then I remember that the prices for an IPS panel are around 60/70€ and the TN panel is starting to suit me.\nA little reflection Every component can be replaced at this Thinkpad: RAM, SSD, WLAN, WWAN, bluetooth, display, keyboard, expresscard, and who knows what else. This gives me pause; in today’s notebooks it is a plus when RAM is not soldered in and a luxury when the slots on the motherboard are two.\nThis Thinkpad model, but other references in general, have held their own against other notebooks for a good 10 years and, in my opinion, it is far ahead of many low and mid-range notebooks on the market today and coming out in the next few years. Thinkpads hardly get old.\nIn benchmarks the processor in this X230, an i5 3320M, performs better than an i3 6100U. The figure is realistic and I can comfirm it as I have had a chance to try both processors. The fluidity of this X230 is absurd considering that it is 10 years old, there is no lag and no slowdown.\nThe portability is great and on par with a thin notebook, maybe not a Thinkpad X1 Nano.\nWhat computer could an average user buy today in the 100€-200€ range with these features? None. There is little innovation in the technology market, and few things can be found that are actually worth what they cost, justifying their purchase. It may be because of rising production and energy costs, the innovation curve or lack of teams of visionaries, but what I wrote is a fact.\nThe used market is hardly considered by average users, perhaps due to lack of product information or perhaps out of fear of receiving a product that does not conform to the description. Finding a good product in the used market is difficult, it requires knowledge, a good amount of free time, and the ability to get by on making a repair or a small upgrade. At a time like the present, it is critical that the average user’s approach to used equipment change.\nIt is not about giving new life to a now-discontinued product, but using it until it has a useful life, and beyond.\nOften we replace our tools prematurely, getting caught up in new models and overly appealing advertisements. The euphoria after purchase lasts a few hours, but we realize that, after all, the new product is not at all different from what we had before. It is also the fault of companies that fail to design products that bond the user with the product they buy.\nIn this regard, I recommend that you watch episode 9x19 of The Big bang Theory.\nThis Thinkpad succeeds very well in this being amazing and I am not surprised that quite a few have been sold, sure at the release the price was high, but people are still buying them now and the reason is obvious: it is a well-made product. The only thing I’m still pondering is if I had purchased a Thinkpad X230 in 2013 would I still be using it? Are those who bought it in 2013 still using it?\n","wordCount":"2197","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://giacomopeli.com/posts/x230/copertina.JPG","datePublished":"2022-09-17T11:30:03Z","dateModified":"2022-09-17T11:30:03Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Giacomo Peli"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://giacomopeli.com/posts/thinkpadx230/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Giacomo Peli","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://giacomopeli.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/ accesskey=h title="Giacomo Peli (Alt + H)">Giacomo Peli</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/posts/ title=Post><span>Post</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/bookshelf/ title=Bookshelf><span>Bookshelf</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://giacomopeli.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Finally I bought a Thinkpad X230</h1><div class=post-description>My new Thinkpad X230 and a little reflection on mid-range and low-end laptops.</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-09-17 11:30:03 +0000 +0000'>17 September 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Giacomo Peli</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://giacomopeli.com/posts/x230/copertina.JPG alt="A Thinkpad X230 keyboard"><p>The Thinkpad X230 keyboard</p></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#the-ebay-auction aria-label="The ebay auction">The ebay auction</a></li><li><a href=#unboxing-and-good-vibes aria-label="Unboxing and good vibes">Unboxing and good vibes</a></li><li><a href=#battery-check aria-label="Battery check">Battery check</a></li><li><a href=#arch-linux-btw aria-label="Arch Linux, btw">Arch Linux, btw</a></li><li><a href=#my-custom-setup-for-thinkpad-x230 aria-label="My custom setup for Thinkpad X230">My custom setup for Thinkpad X230</a></li><li><a href=#analyze-temperatures-and-fan-to-avoid-changing-thermal-paste aria-label="Analyze temperatures and fan to avoid changing thermal paste">Analyze temperatures and fan to avoid changing thermal paste</a></li><li><a href=#upgrades-im-considering aria-label="Upgrades I&amp;rsquo;m considering">Upgrades I&rsquo;m considering</a><ul><li><a href=#retrofitting-the-x220-keyboard aria-label="Retrofitting the X220 keyboard">Retrofitting the X220 keyboard</a></li><li><a href=#express-card-with-3x-usb-30 aria-label="Express Card with 3x USB 3.0">Express Card with 3x USB 3.0</a></li><li><a href=#ram-upgrade aria-label="RAM upgrade">RAM upgrade</a></li><li><a href=#storage-upgrade aria-label="Storage upgrade">Storage upgrade</a></li><li><a href=#display-ips aria-label="Display IPS">Display IPS</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#a-little-reflection aria-label="A little reflection">A little reflection</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>It all started when I needed a netbook that would allow me to focus on writing; a task that

but they are still around 50°C, and at this very moment when I am writing this it is 43°C and the fan has not started,
as if it were fanless.</p><p>At full speed it even reaches over 70°C. The air outlet slots are located on the left side of the laptop and if you rest your left hand
on the desk to the side of the Thinkpad you can feel the warm air, but nothing too annoying. It will be pleasant to use this winter!</p><p>Several online users have complained that the fans on these models are quite noisy. True, the fan can be heard, but in
very light and only at high load. I have very fine hearing and usually the fans on desktop desktops bother me a lot, but the one
of my Thinkpad most people would not even hear it.</p><p>Having made these considerations, I have decided not to disassemble the Thinkpad just to replace the thermal paste, but I will only take the opportunity when I make upgrades.</p><h2 id=upgrades-im-considering>Upgrades I&rsquo;m considering<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#upgrades-im-considering>#</a></h2><p>Among the various upgrades I have seen online there are:</p><h3 id=retrofitting-the-x220-keyboard>Retrofitting the X220 keyboard<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#retrofitting-the-x220-keyboard>#</a></h3><p>As mentioned above, the keyboard on the X230 can be replaced with the better one on the X220. <em>IBM</em> keyboards in Italian are hard to find; it is
a very popular upgrade and one that many X230 owners make. After writing this article I can say that I don&rsquo;t have any
need it, I am already very comfortable with it.</p><p>Here you can find a video of <em>Classic Dome</em> about the keyboard swap.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4_6LQrmu14 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h3 id=express-card-with-3x-usb-30>Express Card with 3x USB 3.0<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#express-card-with-3x-usb-30>#</a></h3><p>On online ecommerce stores you can find express cards compatible with three USB 3.0 ports. Having three additional USB 3.0 ports on this
Thinkpad would not be bad, but it still remains a whim since I would not need them. Also, these expresscards remain
always powered and drain power from the battery, which is definitely inconvenient.</p><figure><img loading=lazy src="https://preview.redd.it/2b2sllx1whey.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9b6fb24156976ee0433b1262934514b4b5f4fbec"><figcaption>Something similir to what I mentioned above. Image from a Reddit post.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=ram-upgrade>RAM upgrade<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ram-upgrade>#</a></h3><p>I&rsquo;ve bought it with 8 Gb yet, upgrading it to 16 Gb would be useless.</p><h3 id=storage-upgrade>Storage upgrade<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#storage-upgrade>#</a></h3><p>I bought this Thinkpad with a new 256GB SSD, and I don&rsquo;t feel like I need to increase the space further. However,
this Thinkpad has a WWAN module that allows internet connection via a sim card. I don&rsquo;t know if I will ever use
this feature and, in fact, I am considering replacing this WWAN card with a 128GB msata SSD where I could place my <em>Linux</em> <em>/home</em> folder.</p><h3 id=display-ips>Display IPS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#display-ips>#</a></h3><p>One of the downsides of this Thinkpad is that it mounts a TN panel, which is quite ugly and impractical for everyday use.
Perhaps, for writing, I could compromise with this, although at the moment it remains a pain to see the colors of different shades between the top and bottom of the display. While looking for the right angle to make up for this gap between too
light and too dark, I cannot find a reason to keep this panel. Then I remember that the prices for an IPS panel are
around 60/70€ and the TN panel is starting to suit me.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2mF6rhZemhM style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=a-little-reflection>A little reflection<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-little-reflection>#</a></h2><p>Every component can be replaced at this Thinkpad: RAM, SSD, WLAN, WWAN, bluetooth, display, keyboard, expresscard, and who knows
what else. This gives me pause; in today&rsquo;s notebooks it is a plus when RAM is not soldered in and a luxury when the slots
on the motherboard are two.</p><p>This Thinkpad model, but other references in general, have held their own against other notebooks for a good 10 years and, in my
opinion, it is far ahead of many low and mid-range notebooks on the market today and coming out in the next few years.
Thinkpads hardly get old.</p><p>In benchmarks the processor in this X230, an i5 3320M, performs better than an i3 6100U. The figure is realistic and I can
comfirm it as I have had a chance to try both processors. The fluidity of this X230 is absurd considering that it is
10 years old, there is no lag and no slowdown.</p><p>The portability is great and on par with a thin notebook, maybe not a <em>Thinkpad X1 Nano</em>.</p><p>What computer could an average user buy today in the 100€-200€ range with these features? None.
There is little innovation in the technology market, and few things can be found that are actually worth what they cost, justifying their purchase. It may be because of rising production and energy costs, the innovation curve or lack of teams of
visionaries, but what I wrote is a fact.</p><p>The used market is hardly considered by average users, perhaps due to lack of product information or
perhaps out of fear of receiving a product that does not conform to the description. Finding a good product in the used market is difficult,
it requires knowledge, a good amount of free time, and the ability to get by on making a repair or a small
upgrade. At a time like the present, it is critical that the average user&rsquo;s approach to used equipment change.</p><blockquote><p>It is not
about giving new life to a now-discontinued product, but using it until it has a useful life, and beyond.</p></blockquote><p>Often
we replace our tools prematurely, getting caught up in new models and overly appealing advertisements. The euphoria
after purchase lasts a few hours, but we realize that, after all, the new product is not at all different from what we had
before. It is also the fault of companies that fail to design products that bond the user with the product they buy.</p><p>In this regard, I recommend that you watch episode 9x19 of The Big bang Theory.</p><p>This Thinkpad succeeds very well in this <em>being amazing</em> and I am not surprised that quite a few have been sold, sure at the release the price
was high, but people are still buying them now and the reason is obvious: it is a well-made product. The only thing I&rsquo;m still pondering is if
I had purchased a Thinkpad X230 in 2013 would I still be using it? Are those who bought it in 2013 still using it?</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/tags/tech/>tech</a></li><li><a
