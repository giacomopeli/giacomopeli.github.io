After using it quite a bit I can say that ereaders are extraordinarily useful and functional; everyone should own one. True, they are not multitasking devices, but that, in my opinion, is their forte: they do one thing and they do it damn well, without distraction.\nUnfortunately, my Clara Hd came out in 2018 and the battery readings were completely starred. Despite showing the charge percentage at 40% the battery was completely drained. After trying them all I really think my Kobo does not provide a battery calibration mode, doing cycles from zero to one hundred percent was always useless. So I removed the battery from the Kobo and bought a circuit that charges lithium-ion cells. After soldering two terminals and printing a 3d case, I started charging the battery through this circuit board. It took me almost six hours. Now the battery seems to hold a charge and the Kobo seems to take true battery readings. The circuit is this, you can use it to recover many lithium batteries and it is quite inexpensive.\nIn writing this article, I was inspired by the one written by Anarcat on his blog. Also, if I ever reset my Kobo, I will just follow this article so that I will not forget anything. I hope it can be useful for you readers as well.\nLet’s make it new We start from scratch: first we reset the Kobo, as if it were new.\nWe go to settings, then to device information and then to factory reset. From there, the device will begin restoring to factory settings.\nIn case you cannot get to this menu, you can do the reset by holding down the power button until we see the notice that the Kobo is resetting. This will not take long.\nNo account, thanks Once turned on, the Kobo will ask us to set the language, we select the language we want and reach the screen where we are asked to log in with our account.\nDownload sqlite3 to your computer, if you use Arch Linux type the command to open the file you want to edit via sqlite3\nparu -S sqlite3 Connect the device to the computer, go to the .kobo folder and open a terminal. From there, type\nsudo sqlite3 KoboReader.sqlite When opening the cli interface of sqlite3 type the following command\nINSERT INTO user(UserID,UserKey) VALUES('1',''); Since I will not be buying any ebooks from online stores I have no need to be logged in on my kobo, and besides, when I can protect my privacy it is good to do so.\nUpdate to the latest firmware without logging in To install the latest firmware version you need to download the latest version for your ereader from here and extract the zip file in the .kobo directory. As you unmount your Kobo it will start to update, wait until it’s finished.\nTransfer files to the Kobo with kobocloud I use syncthing on a daily basis to synchronize with a peer-to-peer network my files, and I could have used this very service to synchronize my books, but I happened to want to put a book in and not have access to my network or my main devices. I therefore discarded synchting as an option.\nkobocloud allows me to keep a Google Drive folder synchronized on my Kobo. Every time the Kobo turns on or comes out of standby mode it checks to see if any files have been added to the Google Drive folder, in which case it syncs it and downloads the missing files. This way I can add ebooks to Google Drive from any device and from any account and be sure to find them on the Kobo. This service works very well and I highly recommend it.\nTo install it, download the latest KoboRoot.tgz from the release page of kobocloud. Put it in .kobo folder and disconnect your device from your computer. Wait until it’s updated.\nNow give to your Google Drive folder the necessary privileges and copy the link into .add/kobocloud/kobocloudrc.\nYou can find it explained more detailed here.\nMore options with Nickel Menu By default, my Kobo Clara HD does not have necessary features enabled such as screen rotation, dark mode, and the ability to turn off and restart the device from the main menu. As in the previous steps, you download the KoboRoot.tgz file, copy it to the .kobo folder, disconnect the device, and wait until it has installed. Next, after reconnecting the Kobo to the computer, we go to the .adds/nm folder. Here we will find a file called doc, in this we find all the instructions and options that we can enable via nickel menu. It is important that we do not edit the doc file, but create one with any name, I called it nickelconfig. The settings I enabled can be found below.\n#main_menu menu_item:main:Portrait:nickel_orientation:portrait menu_item:main:Landscape Right:nickel_orientation:landscape menu_item:main:Landscape Left:nickel_orientation:inverted_landscape menu_item:main:Shutdown:power:shutdown menu_item:main:Reboot:power:reboot menu_item:main:Dark mode:nickel_setting:toggle:dark_mode #reader_menu menu_item:reader:Portrait:nickel_orientation:portrait menu_item:reader:Landscape Right:nickel_orientation:landscape menu_item:reader:Landscape Left:nickel_orientation:inverted_landscape menu_item:reader:Shutdown:power:shutdown menu_item:reader:Reboot:power:reboot menu_item:reader:Dark mode:nickel_setting:toggle:dark_mode For more informations please read doc and navigate to this link.\nManage your library with Calibre Online ebooks can be found with different formats, but the best format for kobo is the .kepub format. Calibre allows us to use a folder on our computer as if it were a real library. We can put books in any format and then convert them, change covers, make collections, and arrange authors, series, publishers, and other things that will keep everything very neat. This folder is located on my server, so I can access this from any device on my local network, as long as it has calibre installed on the computer. The books I’m interested in I later drag them into the Google Drive folder, which will automatically sync.\nExport notes and annotations When I read with printed paper I emphasize a lot, I could say, actually, that I struggle to read if in addition to the book I don’t also have a pencil in my hand. On the Kobo I can do this as well. For me exporting notes is very important, as I go through them on Overleaf and layout them with LaTex.\nExporting notes is a hidden feature and needs to be enabled.\nGo to .kobo/Kobo/Kobo eReader.conf and add\n[FeatureSettings] ExportHighlights=true Remove the Kobo’s connection with the computer and reboot. Holding down the book whose notes we want to export will bring up an Export highlights menu, clicking it will ask us what name we want to save the notes under, the format will be .txt. The notes will be saved locally on the kobo in the Exported Annotations folder.\nBest fonts for an ereader On the various Kobo we can install the fonts we like best. This function, may seem trivial, but it is a useful function many people, especially for those who suffer from dyslexia.\nTo install fonts on a Kobo is very simple, just create a folder with the name fonts in the root directory and copy inside it the fonts we want to use for reading. Fonts can be installed in either .ttf or .otf format.\nIn my opinion you should try these fonts.\nFantasque Sans Mono\nRoboto Condensed\nPalatino\nAtkinsons Hyperlegible\nReading and the five senses Ereaders are dumb and slow devices, but that is what makes them appeal to a wider and wider circle of people, and I think these can bring many people closer to reading. The eink technology can improve a lot and can have many applications in the future, just think of all the panels in a home automation home or the screens on household appliances.\nI’m taking the Kobo on vacation this year. But what if it stops working? For that very reason I will also take paper books with me. Uereaders are not reading devices, but complementary to reading. One day a man who is passionate about music told me that man has five senses and that is why vinyl records still have value today. The same thing applies to books, the book you read tomorrow will not smell the same as yesterday’s book and the paper will probably be rougher and perhaps heavier. Printed paper manages to find its own identity to this day. An electronic device can hold an entire library inside, but it can never replace the reading experience of holding a paper book in your hands.\nMore resources Although there are many ways to customize one’s experience of using these devices, I struggled to find well-done guides that summarized the main steps. There are many other things that could be installed on a Kobo, but I am already comfortable with them. However, I leave below some useful links that I have found.\nKobo Topic on Github Latest firmwares for Kobos on pgaskin website.\nHacking my Kobo Clara HD from Anarcat.\n","wordCount":"1502","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-25T11:30:03Z","dateModified":"2023-07-25T11:30:03Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Giacomo Peli"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://giacomopeli.com/posts/kobo/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Giacomo Peli","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://giacomopeli.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/ accesskey=h title="Giacomo Peli (Alt + H)">Giacomo Peli</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/posts/ title=Post><span>Post</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/bookshelf/ title=Bookshelf><span>Bookshelf</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://giacomopeli.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://giacomopeli.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Hacking a Kobo Clara HD after 5 years since release</h1><div class=post-description>A small guide on how to hack a Kobo to make the best use of it.</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-25 11:30:03 +0000 +0000'>25 July 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Giacomo Peli</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#a-little-hint-about-my-kobo aria-label="A little hint about my Kobo">A little hint about my Kobo</a></li><li><a href=#lets-make-it-new aria-label="Let&amp;rsquo;s make it new">Let&rsquo;s make it new</a></li><li><a href=#no-account-thanks aria-label="No account, thanks">No account, thanks</a></li><li><a href=#update-to-the-latest-firmware-without-logging-in aria-label="Update to the latest firmware without logging in">Update to the latest firmware without logging in</a></li><li><a href=#transfer-files-to-the-kobo-with-kobocloud aria-label="Transfer files to the Kobo with kobocloud">Transfer files to the Kobo with <em>kobocloud</em></a></li><li><a href=#more-options-with-nickel-menu aria-label="More options with Nickel Menu">More options with <em>Nickel Menu</em></a></li><li><a href=#manage-your-library-with-calibre aria-label="Manage your library with Calibre">Manage your library with <em>Calibre</em></a></li><li><a href=#export-notes-and-annotations aria-label="Export notes and annotations">Export notes and annotations</a></li><li><a href=#best-fonts-for-an-ereader aria-label="Best fonts for an ereader">Best fonts for an ereader</a></li><li><a href=#reading-and-the-five-senses aria-label="Reading and the five senses">Reading and the five senses</a></li><li><a href=#more-resources aria-label="More resources">More resources</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=a-little-hint-about-my-kobo>A little hint about my Kobo<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-little-hint-about-my-kobo>#</a></h2><p>I have owned a Kobo Clara HD for a few months now, and I must say that while I am an ardent supporter of reading in print, it has its charms.

For me exporting notes is very important, as I go through them on Overleaf and layout them with LaTex.</p><p>Exporting notes is a hidden feature and needs to be enabled.</p><p>Go to <code>.kobo/Kobo/Kobo eReader.conf</code> and add</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-text data-lang=text><span style=display:flex><span>[FeatureSettings]
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>ExportHighlights=true
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Remove the Kobo&rsquo;s connection with the computer and reboot. Holding down the book whose notes we want to export will bring up an <em>Export highlights</em> menu, clicking it will ask us what name we want to save the notes under, the format will be .txt. The notes will be saved locally on the kobo in the <em>Exported Annotations</em> folder.</p><h2 id=best-fonts-for-an-ereader>Best fonts for an ereader<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-fonts-for-an-ereader>#</a></h2><p>On the various Kobo we can install the fonts we like best. This function, may seem trivial, but it is a useful function many people, especially for those who suffer from dyslexia.</p><p>To install fonts on a Kobo is very simple, just create a folder with the name <em>fonts</em> in the root directory and copy inside it the fonts we want to use for reading. Fonts can be installed in either <code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code> format.</p><p>In my opinion you should try these fonts.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans target=_blank rel=noopener>Fantasque Sans Mono</a></p><p><a href=https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed target=_blank rel=noopener>Roboto Condensed</a></p><p>Palatino</p><p><a href=https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible target=_blank rel=noopener>Atkinsons Hyperlegible</a></p><h2 id=reading-and-the-five-senses>Reading and the five senses<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reading-and-the-five-senses>#</a></h2><p>Ereaders are <em>dumb</em> and <em>slow</em> devices, but that is what makes them appeal to a wider and wider circle of people, and I think these can bring many people closer to reading.
The <em>eink</em> technology can improve a lot and can have many applications in the future, just think of all the panels in a home automation home or the screens on household appliances.</p><p>I&rsquo;m taking the Kobo on vacation this year. But what if it stops working? For that very reason I will also take paper books with me. Uereaders are not reading devices, but complementary to reading. One day a man who is passionate about music told me that man has five senses and that is why vinyl records still have value today. The same thing applies to books, the book you read tomorrow will not smell the same as yesterday&rsquo;s book and the paper will probably be rougher and perhaps heavier. Printed paper manages to find its own identity to this day. An electronic device can hold an entire library inside, but it can never replace the reading experience of holding a paper book in your hands.</p><h2 id=more-resources>More resources<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#more-resources>#</a></h2><p>Although there are many ways to customize one&rsquo;s experience of using these devices, I struggled to find well-done guides that summarized the main steps. There are many other things that could be installed on a Kobo, but I am already comfortable with them. However, I leave below some useful links that I have found.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/topics/kobo target=_blank rel=noopener>Kobo Topic on Github</a>
