Reading Isaac Asimov taught me that the science fiction genre anticipates and dictates the guidelines of the future.\n I’ve never seen Start Trek, but you can find many videos online about what is called “the Replicator”. It creates objects and food from need in short time. 3D printing is what the Replicator aims to be, or rather, 3D printing aims to be what the Replicator is. Fun fact: some first 3D printer models were named Replicator in honour of this concept and they even emulate its shape. But the process isn’t that simple. As the Star Trek’s Replicator creates objects just from nothing, the actual process needs a material that has to be processed using energy so that it can be continuously added to itself. This is called additive manufacturing and 3d printing is just its mainstream name. Generally manufacturing processes subtract material. Think how you would create a screw: you would have to subtract metal from a cylindrical piece of metal; additive manufacturing functions exactly the opposite. There are a lot of types of 3D printing. There are processes that are based on the photopolymerization of resins and there are processes that are based on polymer fused filament deposition. In addition, there are processes that use lasers to fuse layers of metal powder together one after the other. If you think that 3D printing is so futuristic, you should know that it started to be developed in the 80’s, only few years after Star Trek TV show.\nMy journey I started FDM 3D printing exactly one year ago, January 2021. Before, I had always heard about it on the Internet, but it had never interested me. Then, I heard about additive manufacturing in a university course and slowly became interested. I really got into it when a university friend told me about it. I saw his filament printer and was convinced to buy one. As I’m studying to become an engineer, I immediately took a scientific approach, and this was a principle of my journey. I had never been in contact with 3d design and cad drawing before, so I started to learn cad drawing during the ship, because just printing downloaded objects online is for newbs. I’m very proud of the software I chose. 3D printing, during this pandemic year full of restrictions, has helped me a lot to keep my head busy. I have come into touch with many people and realities that I would not have known if it wasn’t for 3D printing. I have met local realities across Italy and amazing projects that people are working on.\nThings I’ve learned from 3D printing 3D printing is very frustrating because it presents problems one after the other and it is a continuos flow of debugging, repairing, and tuning the machine. Most of the learning comes from the experience, so I have had the opportunity to learn a lot. I don’t only mean the technical aspects, but also the human ones, for example, as 3D printing often takes more time than you have, I have learnt to be patient and what patience really is, think of it as a zen or a philosophical thing.\nTechnical knowledge I have learnt with 3D printing As you can imagine, in a huge environment as 3D printing there are a lot of things to learn, but main technical knowledge from FDM 3D printing that I’ve learned in this journey are cad drawing, material optimization and mechanical maintenance of the machine. There is more to what you can learn from your own experience than what you can find online. Many times, I’ve searched for tutorials and solutions to my problems online, sometimes I’ve found them online in just a few seconds, but many times I’ve found the wrong ones from who made things so easy when they are not. Simplistic things and 3D printing don’t go together. When I think about that, I think about how many people solved their problems copying and pasting solutions from tutorials or by searching random parameters because those tutorials hadn’t given them a solution. In this way, many times you don’t learn nothing. That’s passive knowledge and it’s very fast to achieve, but it’s very weak. I’ve seen many people in communities assume they have knowledge because they have something, maybe a printer better than yours, but does having a Ferrari mean you are Schumacher? No, of course. What you have to try is to achieve knowledge in an active way, it takes a lot of time and patience but you will have a stronger knowledge and become more skilled.\nHuman aspects When you enter a new environment, it is very frustrating because you don’t know anything about how things work and many times you don’t have any reliable resource to learn from. This takes time and patience. Since I started 3D printing, I’ve learned to admit to myself that I don’t know enough about something (in this case, 3D printing). This led me to do two things: ask people for help and experiment a lot. Contrary to what I thought, a lot of people do 3D printing. Apparently, this sounds good because you should have more people and resources to learn from, but it’s not. When a community grows, many people tend to overrate their knowledge and they judge everything it’s posted, and this is why you always ask for help with an eye on.\nPatience I’ve learned to be very patient. 3D printers aren’t perfect and there’s always something to repair, tune or optimize. The first few times that things didn’t work out I was frustrated. I didn’t know anything beyond the academic knowledge about of materials and being good with computers. When you enter a new environment and its new way of thinking that doesn’t suit your mind, you need to do a hard reset of what your initial thoughts were and learn the basics. Starting from scratch takes time, but it’s the only way to enter a new environment and to become skilled (for example take math, you wouldn’t be able to solve an integral without knowing the basic operations). That requires a lot of patience. When you try to a problem, the first things you see are the consequences, so you follow the path of the problem by analysing it and searching the causes in order to solve it. During this it is very easy to get lost. This trains your head a lot and tests your patience by improving your problem-solving skills.\nReceiving and giving help Many times, when I was stuck on a problem, if I didn’t receive help, I wouldn’t have solved anything. Finding skilled and helpful people in the community is very hard, but not that as hard as finding people that can give you their time for free. In this journey I’ve known very helpful people that have a much greater knowledge than I do. Giving help is important because, as I’ve experimented, it’s the only way people can make a community better. That’s not that complex, helping each other is the key.\nAdmitting you don’t know One of the hardest things I’ve come across is asking people for help because, in addition to the frustration of not being able to solve something on my own, I had to swallow my pride in admitting that I didn’t know the necessary knowledge and also because the few helpful people you find are giving their time for nothing.\nBad communities In writing this article, I thought that telling about how many bad communities there are online about 3D printing wasn’t necessary. But there’s one particular episode that takes me out from most groups and communities. I needed to print several copies of the same object without starting printing and setting up the machine every time. So, I created an algorithm to automate the process and coded the software. I posted it in a youtuber’s telegram group about 3D printing and was told me to avoid that kind of message because they thought it was to promote me. I coded a piece of software that solves a problem, uploaded it for free, posted in a group and was told me that it wasn’t the right place because it was the youtuber’s community, not mine, not ours. That wasn’t spam and it wasn’t to promote myself. Many people wrote to me in those days because they were enjoying it. Otherwise, another person asked me to going live on his channel and talk about it and explain how my software works. In my opinion, that was the right approach. Now the same software has been copied by a company and they put it up for sale on another website, but I don’t care and I probably will not release any updates. From my experience, I would not recommend joining a community if you are the beginning.\nMy vision of the future As I see the future, 3D printing would become very popular and available to everyone. Now it is in an embryonic stage and there is still a lot to develop to make it for everyone, but in the future, I think it would be part of everyone’s house furniture. I imagine that many appliance companies will no longer include many optional parts in your furniture in order to reduce costs and waste, but they will upload the file online, allow you to download it for free and you can print it if you need it. Also, car companies are moving on this concept as they’re developing upgradable dashboards and their related upgrades for printing, for example phone holders, cup holders or sunglasses holders. By having an upgradable and customizable object you could create an upgrade as you like or you could print a third-party one. Basically, you bought a new fridge and you paid it less than the full optional model because yours doesn’t have the handle and the egg holder, but who really use the egg holder on a fridge? So you can just print the handle at home and pay a lot less of it. Generally, 3D printing produces less waste than the classical method of producing things.\nWASP, an Italian company that also works in the field of green building, is printing houses using printers developed by themselves and materials found on site. They don’t use bricks but they print walls using a specific pattern that can be filled with organic waste like those produced from rice. This makes it possible to build efficient houses in just a few hours and also to reduce the amount of concrete used and therefore the carbon dioxide released. This will be crucial in developing countries.\n3D printing is now finding application in biomechanics and biomedicine. Making prostheses for humans, but also for animals, is becoming less expensive thanks to 3D printing. For example, there are scanners that capture 3D model of your foot so you can have a perfect footbed for your feet in a few hours. This model can be also captured by your shoemaker who can make the perfect pair of shoes for you. Now think that your shoemaker and your podiatrist can be the same person. This is part of how we can survive the small businesses crisis and this figure is what I have called craftsman 2.0 but maybe that will be part of another article.\n","wordCount":"1899","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://giacomopeli.com/posts/oneyearof3dprinting/posts/3dprinter.jpg","datePublished":"2022-01-14T11:30:03Z","dateModified":"2022-01-14T11:30:03Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Giacomo Peli"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://giacomopeli.com/posts/oneyearof3dprinting/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Giacomo Peli","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://giacomopeli.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

<p>WASP, an Italian company that also works in the field of green building, is printing houses using printers developed by themselves and materials found on site. They don’t use bricks but they print walls using a specific pattern that can be filled with organic waste like those produced from rice. This makes it possible to build efficient houses in just a few hours and also to reduce the amount of concrete used and therefore the carbon dioxide released. This will be crucial in developing countries.</p>
<p>3D printing is now finding application in biomechanics and biomedicine. Making prostheses for humans, but also for animals, is becoming less expensive thanks to 3D printing. For example, there are scanners that capture 3D model of your foot so you can have a perfect footbed for your feet in a few hours. This model can be also captured by your shoemaker who can make the perfect pair of shoes for you. Now think that your shoemaker and your podiatrist can be the same person. This is part of how we can survive the small businesses crisis and this figure is what I have called <em>craftsman 2.0</em> but maybe that will be part of another article.</p>
